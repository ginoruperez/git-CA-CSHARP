Create a solution to each of the scenarios set out below. The solutions should be written in C# console applications. 


1.	Miles-per Gallon					
A car’s miles per gallon (MPG) can be calculated with the following formula.

MPG = Miles driven / Gallons of petrol used

Write a program that asks the user for the number of miles driven and the gallons of petrol used.
It should calculate the car’s miles per gallon and display the result on the screen.

2.	Guess the Number 
Create a C# console application which allows two players to play the game "Guess the number" 

The program should ask the first player to enter a secret number. The secret number must be between 0-20. Once the player has entered the number the screen should be cleared of all text. 

The program should then give the second player 3 attempts to guess player ones number. If the second player guesses the number correctly, a congratulatory message should be displayed on the screen.

If they guess too low, the message should read "Your guess is too low". If their guess is too high the message should read "Your guess is too high". 

If the second player hasn't guessed the number after 3 attempts, you should display the message " Hard Luck, the number was x" (x being the secret number)


3.	Array and Method 

Write a console application that fulfils the following requirements. 

-	Create an array of grades. Enter the following values 34.7, 56.9, 75, 52, 92.2
-	Print to the screen the size of the array. 
-	Print to the screen the value 56.9.
-	Print every value in the array to the screen. 
-	Write 2 methods, one that returns a name and the other that returns the age of the user.
-	Pass their age and name into a new method that calculates the year they were born.  Print to the screen “X you were born in Y” X being their name and y being the year they were born.
